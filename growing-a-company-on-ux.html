	<h1 class="header">Mozio: Aligning, and growing, a company around a culture of UX</h1>

<p>
	<span class="subtitle">
		This article is about how user experience (UX) can help grow your product and
		align your business. If you want to skip to the work done with Mozio immediately,
		<a href="#mozio-work">click here</a>.
	</span>
</p>

	<p>
	It's not a novel statement to say <span style="font-style:italic;">"Design for
		the user first if you want to see growth".</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	But in this age of User Experience, to have your application or website solve
	the problem is not enough. If you're not helping the user in the easiest possible
	way, without fuss or bother...  your product is not going to stick. And you won't
	reach your full potential for growing.
	</p>

	<p>
	Addressing your users intent and help them accomplish it with delight is a
	reliable way to make them keep using your product. And if it also supports the
	narrative they look to live… Well, then you will have a real competitive advantage.
	</p>

	<p>
	You can build around KPIs like acquisition, onboarding, retention and churn.
	That satisfies the hunger, but doesn't solve the problem.
	</p>

	<p>
	Founders will benefit from having empathy beyond metrics. Because people will
	be ok being sold to if they see and feel the company has their best interests
	in mind.
	</p>

	<p>
	Your company won't enjoy your users goodwill if you don't embrace this idea.
	A competitors that does will have the upper hand.
	</p>


	<span style="font-weight: bold;">Common mistakes include:</span>
	<ul>
		<li>Not talking to your market before you start on an idea</li>
		<li>Over-engineering the solution with too many features</li>
		<li>Thinking "User Experience" and "Design" is for designers only</li>
	</ul>


	<h2>The case for Mozio: Operating remotely</h2>

	<p>
	User experience, when embraced at all company levels, can be a powerful way to
	align a team. Doesn't matter if you're 2 founders with an idea or a 30,000 people
	conglomerate.
	</p>

	<p>
	One example which I had the opportunity to work with was Mozio. They make user
	experience their central philosophy. They believe the Travel experience should
	be simple and enjoyable. And they make it their brand promise to do that.
	</p>

	<p><blockquote>User experience should start at the brand promise.</blockquote></p>

	<p>
	From Taxis to Buses to Tuk-tuks... Mozio lets you search and compare all types
	of ground transportation, and book one that makes the most sense for your wallet
	and schedule.
	</p>

	<div class="image-block">
		<img  class="post-image" src="img/mozio/journey.jpg" alt="The travelers journey">
		<span class="subtitle">Use case: Has flight booked, need a ride to the airport.</span>
	</div>

	<p>
	Based in San Francisco, Mozio operates with an entirely remote team of 60+
	colleagues distributed across all timezones.
	</p>

	<p><blockquote>If you ever thought managing a few freelancers was difficult…</blockquote></p>

	<p>
	Companies have the challenge of keeping people motivated and in alignment.
	Operating remotely increases this challenge. People are more likely to drift
	apart and disconnect.
	</p>

	<p>
	Talented project managers alleviates this. But people have to believe in the
	brand promise and align with the company goals.
	</p>

	<p>
	A single language everyone can speak is paramount. Mozio used their mission to
	improve the traveler's - their user - experience as the common voice.
	</p>

	<p>
	By embracing this across all teams - design, development, sales and executive -
	and making it part of every chat, Skype call and board meeting…
	</p>

	<p><blockquote>"How is this making their journey easier?"</blockquote></p>

	<p>
	It makes sure the team works in sync. Goals are clear and everyone knows what
	they work for: To help the user find and book his ride in the best possible way.
	</p>

	<p>
	In turn, the user reciprocates by using and coming back to Mozio.
	</p>

</div>

	<h2 id="mozio-work">How it applied:</h2>

	<p>
	As a remote UX/UI Designer, my role was to structure ideas and research into
	solutions that we could design and grow with.
	</p>

	<p>
	This included KPI optimisations, new features or new products altogether. Such
	as Mozio's web app redesign and their mobile app.
	</p>

<div class="image-block">
		<img class="post-image" src="img/mozio/web-app.gif" alt="Mozio web funnel">
</div>

	<p>
	Redesigning the website UI was an iterative process. It included developing and
	using a new visual language to build a library of UI components. We introduced
	them as they came.
	</p>

	<div class="image-block">
		<img class="post-image" src="img/mozio/component-card.png" alt="Mozio UI components">
		<span class="subtitle">Mozio UI component: Search transport cards</span>
	</div>

	<div class="image-block">
		<img class="post-image" src="img/mozio/component-dropdown.png" alt="Mozio UI components">
		<span class="subtitle">Mozio UI components: Dropdown selectors</span>
	</div>

	<p>
	The design process was not sectioned. Rather, it was collaborative and organic,
	with plenty of back & forth between different departments.
	</p>

	<p>
	This meant juggling several projects side by side, keeping versions up to date
	and managing expectations with all teams.
	</p>


	<h2>Researching our use cases</h2>

	<p>
	User feedback and insight often came from Customer Support, Sales and Partnership
	teams. Aligned with the core UX philosophy, they were in a position to identify
	new problems and opportunities.
	</p>

Based around open dialogue with our users, it included:
	<ul>
		<li>Qualitative questionnaires</li>
		<li>Email surveys on Post-purchase</li>
		<li>Booking flow Google analytics</li>
		<li>Complaint analysis (Customer support and Review websites)</li>
		<li>Guerilla prototype usability testing</li>
	</ul>


	<h2>Overseeing design to development implementation</h2>

	<p>
	Implementation had a bit of learning curve.
	</p>

	<p>
	We did this with PDF documentation detailing specifications. And video mockups
	to showcase interaction examples.
	</p>

	<p>
	We eventually started using Zeplin as well, a Sketch plugin that provides styling
	information in CSS format.
	</p>

			<span class="subtitle">Roundtrip Upsell (via After Effects)</span>
		</div>

	<h2>Web redesign outcome:</h2>

	<p>
	Mozio platform had it's booking conversion rates increase ~90% over a period of
	3 months. after introducing the new redesign and migrating the framework to React.
	</p>

	<p>
	This provided the necessary growth to acquire a new funding Series.
	</p>

	<h1 class="header">Meanwhile, with the Mobile team...</h1>

	<p>
	Mozio began designing and developing the mobile app, so they could create another
	touchpoint that would get them closer to the user and increase value.
	</p>

	<p>
	Working part of small teams meant working parallel in the mobile app design.
	This came in 3 phases:
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>A tool for customers to manage their tickets</li>
		<li>Allow users to book on-demand and pre-booked rides</li>
		<li>Allow users to book with Heathrow Express (London, UK) and SEPTA
			(Philadelphia, US)</li>
	</ol>
	<br>
	<p>
	When I joined the project, there was already groundwork done for the mobile app.
	Our starting point was a set of ideas and goals established in wireframes by the founders.
	</p>

	<p>
	Meeting this with what we knew of our current web users, we began fleshing out
	Use cases that we could focus on. Together with the developer teams, we designed a
	series of user flows to start building with.
	</p>

<div class="image-block">
	<img class="post-image" src="img/mozio/mobile-flow.gif" alt="Mobile user flow examples">
	<span class="subtitle">Mobile user flow examples</span>
</div>

	<p>
	Wireframes followed, which helped to fine-tune the user flows, in a back and
	forth process.
	</p>

<div class="image-block">
	<img class="post-image" src="img/mozio/wire-map.jpg" alt="Mozio UX culture">
	<span class="subtitle">On-Demand to Pre-booked: Selecting time and day of ride</span>
</div>

	<p>
	I used these wireframes to put together prototypes with InVision and Proto.io.
	We used this to have a better feel for how the app was shaping up.
	</p>

	<p>
	In parallel, Steve Ladanyi, our Lead Designer, started creating a visual style
	for the app's interface.
	</p>

	<p>
	Coming together, high fidelity mockups followed. These were once again built
	into a series of interactive prototypes.
	</p>

		<img class="post-image" src="img/mozio/hex-swap-2.gif" alt="Heathrow Express mobile flow">
		<span class="subtitle">Heathrow Express Mockups</span>
	</div>

	<p>
	Development and design efforts ran side by side. We began working the next
	iterations of the mobile app, including Android adaptation, while working
	with the developer teams to implement the mockups to specification.
	</p>

	<p>
	Mozio rolled out for the first time in Philadelphia, April 27th 2017, in time for the NFL Drafts.
