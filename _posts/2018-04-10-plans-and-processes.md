**TL;DR**

_Process needs business context to work. And in evaluating a designer, it may be more important to figure out how he/she adapts his work-flow in changing contexts than his process._

## 

Reaching out for potential clients and interviews, I’ve been getting asked about my process a lot lately. And you’re probably wondering the same too.

It made me realize I never gave it much thought. So when confronted with it, my first instinct reaction was to recite some step-by-step run down of what acceptable design was.

You might have heard it before, something along the lines of…

_“After discovery, comes research, followed by ideas and wireframes to mockups and finally prototypes and usability tests in some iterate buzz-word manner”_

But how does that tell me anything other than research, is like, important and stuff?

When asking about my process, I started understanding it as the follow: _“Can you be trusted to contextualise my problem, explain to me your plan of action and come up with something that will bring results?”_

To answer it is to give reassurance that you know your shit, and can talk with insight. There is comfort in the predictability of process.

But as annoying as it is, the question needs to be answered with another question.

_“Well, in specific terms, what are you trying to do?”_

Good process is understanding the pieces, what their values are, and how to arrange them on the fly. And it doesn’t exist until there is a starting point and an outcome.

It becomes less of a plan, and more of a game of chess: _When X happens, what do you do?_

_The design thinking process: a great framework that doesn't specifically help your business_

The above diagram is fantastic as an overview for what goes into user-centric design. And smarter people than me have already said _“use it as guidelines, not as a recipe book”._

But we still need context to create a process that fits **your business.**

Context doesn’t need to be complicated. Businesses are in the game to increase revenue, profitable or not. And when it comes to product design, it can be attributed to one of these:

1. The product is **_broken_**, and we need to **_fix it_**_._
2. The product is **_good_**, and we want to **_improve (or grow) it_**_._
3. The product **_doesn’t exist_**, and we need to **_build it_**_._

This gives a starting point for a process.

Constraints follow, and this will be… what is the deadline? Budget runway? What's the current tech available? Features you can grow from?

As these approach strategic decisions, you might not even have a say in many of these, and rather have to deal with… what research resources are made available to you? How are the power dynamics? How much autonomy is expected?

### The conclusion

Process reality can end up being a little bit different than what you set it out to be.

1. _‘The barrel through’ — I know what the user wants, fuck research!_
2. _‘The CEO’ — \*result expected\*_
3. _‘Linear’ — Straight ahead, no backsies!_
4. _‘The Nebulous Hopscotch’ — Just draw the fucking Owl_
5. _‘The Bill O’Riley’ — WE’LL DO IT LIVE!_

And it will matter the most how the designer can take the right decisions given the context, and show the value of these decisions to his peers and stakeholders.

**Final notes**

* Have processes, but liberal in their application.
* Processes ARE important, providing guidance and structure.
* But don’t see them as blanket applications to all design approaches.
* Processes are not plans, but journeys.
