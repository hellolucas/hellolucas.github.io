We want to be the heroes in our own stories.
But we need help along the way to become these heroes.

It’s been a journey that has worked out for me, and maybe my story can be of use to you. It goes something like this…

[ Intent ]

My goal is to help people to fulfill their narratives — and enable people to achieve their life goals, one piece at a time.

I want to use design for this.

I spent a lot of time thrashing around until I figured “to create” was for me.

When I was a kid, I built legos. The I built virtual hospitals and spaceships. What followed after that was a lot of academic rambling and awkward attempts at designing on the side.

It got me though creative advertising, digital marketing and finally, to digital design, where I learned further into UX and interaction design.

And my reason of being became to build awesome things people could use and enjoy.

And all was great...

Until I met a stranger who reason of being was to tell stories.

At the time, I didn’t see this as nothing more than marketing and copywriting. I came to learn this is also a form of design.

Paul Rand says design needs to move things forward.

Then a story moves the reader forward. Whats the difference?

Having an opportunity to view design as a fundamental process, a holistic discipline that embodies the pen on the paper, the idea and the human interaction, and something that comes from everyone.

But before this happened, a lot fighting happened.

Who are these people to challenge me as a designer? 

Almost lost friends over it.

The real choice I have is how I want to interpret, and help people move along their journey.

What part am I building in their narrative?

I choose the a mix of data, structure and visual expression to do this.

Data tells a more accurate truth.

Structure lets me organise things as they are.

Visual expression translates into a language we can all agree on.

Stories, for them to move forward, require actors and objects. These will interact and enable things to happen.

The actors are already there. So its my job to design the objects that will enable them to accomplish things they set out to do.

In less abstract terms, this is product design.

Communicating its true value to the user narrative will create a stronger sense of purpose.

And it will move beyond the features and qualities. Mind, you this is still very important as well — design needs to serve a purpose: solve a pain-point, entertain, educate.

Starts sounding a lot like brand design...

What we want to do.

Why do we want to do it.

How do we do it.

Design will be about building the tangible as it will be about serving the reason.

The promise, the language and the why — will resonate.

Think too narrow, and you’re a technician.

So design for impact, impact in these stories.

Show that you understand their stories, why they are travelling it, and how you will help them achieve.

Design for concrete actions, and show how it enables them to move mountains.

A product is just a commodity unless it tells how its moving you forward.

SO KEEP MOVING FORWARD.
