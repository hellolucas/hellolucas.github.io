<div class="abstract">
	<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
		<p>I worked remotely with Mozio for over 1 year.</p>

		<p>During this time, I helped redesign their website user experience and interface.
			This lead to an increase in booking conversions by 90%+ over a 3-month period after launch.</p>

		<p>Parallel, we designed and developed their iOS and Android apps from concept
			to launch, within 6 months, with an average rating of 4 stars.</p>

		<p>A WYSIWYG Whitelabel Tool was developed for the Sales &amp; Partnership teams.
			This helped close partnerships faster, free developer resources, and improved
			setup time from ~3.5 hours to ~10 minutes.</p>

	<h1 id="ar1-intro">INTRODUCTION</h1>

	<p>Mozio is a Search &amp; Compare app that lets you find all types of ground
		transportation, and book the one that makes the most sense for your wallet
		and schedule.</p>

		<div class="image-block no-shadow full-width">
	 		<img  class="post-image" src="img/mozio/travel-mozio.jpg" alt="The travelers journey">
	 		<span class="subtitle">Mozio believe the travel experience should be simple
				and enjoyable. They place the user experience above all else.</span>
	 	</div>

	<h2 id="ar1-goals">GOALS</h2>

	<p>Mozio wanted to improve booking conversions and increase the types of use
		cases they could serve. They decided to re-design the user experience and
		interface of the main website.</p>

	<p>Mozio also wanted to increase their direct bookings with users. So they began
		design and development of an iOS and Android app that could get them closer
	to travelers.</p>

	<h2 id="ar1-role">MY ROLE</h2>
	<p>I first joined Mozio as a mid-weight UX/UI designer. Together with Steve
		Ladanyi (Lead Designer) we formed a 2-man team that could serve a 55+ co-workers
		working remotely. We later were joined by Federico Sarria (UI & Illustration).
		My role was focused in:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Understanding our users</li>
		<li>Developing use cases</li>
		<li>Shaping them into user flows</li>
		<li>Wireframes</li>
		<li>Prototypes</li>
		<li>...and finding different solutions for new features</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Being a small team also meant my role was fluid, and I would adapt based on
		the work at hand. This included interface design and some front-end coding.</p>

	<p>Over the course of 1 year, this role evolved from supporting to overseeing
		the main website redesign and other internal tools.</p>

	<h1 id="ar1-website">REDESIGNING AN EXISTING WEBSITE</h1>

	<video width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted>
	  <source src="img/mozio/web-app-hd.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	</video>
</div>

	<h2 id="ar1-start-1">GETTING STARTED</h2>

	<p>At start, a few things were already in place: Steve had already began
		designing a new visual style and there was already a lot of user feedback to
	work with, as well as several well understood use cases.</p>

	<p>We began by reviewing these use cases and collaborating with the new UI design.</p>

	<p>I formalised our user into personas and structured the available research so
		we'd make sure use cases were being designed for in full, ensure a functional
	redesign that would improve conversions.</p>

		<div class="image-block">
			<img class="post-image" src="img/mozio/personas.png" alt="Mozio user personas">
			<span class="subtitle">User personas (simplified)</span>
		</div>

	<h2 id="ar1-research">RESEARCHING USERS AND EXPANDING USE CASES</h2>

	<p>User feedback and insight often came from Customer Support, Sales and
		Partnership teams. They were in a position to identify new problems and
		opportunities, from:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Complaint analysis (Customer support and Review websites)</li>
		<li>Email surveys on Post-purchase</li>
		<li>In-depth interviews</li>
	</ul>

	<p>This was put together with other research, including:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Qualitative questionnaires</li>
		<li>Booking flow through Google analytics</li>
		<li>Prototype usability testing</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Research was not exclusive to designers and this meant some advantages:
		Understanding users faster and cheaper, in a greater range of use cases,
		and in live environments.</p>

		<p>From this body of research, issues were wide. Some examples included:</p>

<div class="issue-list">
	<div class="issue-wrapper">
		<img class="column-1 issue-avatar" src="img/mozio/price.svg" alt="unclear pricing"></img>
		<div class="column-2">
			<span class="issue-title">Unclear pricing & Ride time</span>
			<span class="issue-body">Users often wonder if price is per passenger, or
				per ride. They also don't know how long the ride is to decide.</span>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="issue-wrapper">
		<img class="column-1 issue-avatar" src="img/mozio/time.svg" alt="pickup time confusion"></img>
		<div class="column-2">
			<span class="issue-title">Confusion about pickup times</span>
			<span class="issue-body">Users going To/From an airport ride don't know what
				should be their pickup times.
			</span>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="issue-wrapper">
		<img class="column-1 issue-avatar" src="img/mozio/driver.svg" alt="Driver realiability"></img>
		<div class="column-2">
			<span class="issue-title">Uncertainty about driver reliability</span>
			<span class="issue-body">First time users are uncertain if the Driver will
				be arriving on time.</span>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>

	<p>Insights was raw, unstructured and spread, however. Together with the product
		owners, we made sense of the information and began designing solutions prioritised
		on the task complexity vs. business and user impact:</p>

		<div class="image-block no-shadow">
			<img  class="post-image" src="img/mozio/execution-impact.svg" alt="Complexity of execution vs. User impact">
			<span class="subtitle"></span>
		</div>

		<blockquote>Dozens of use cases were designed for, resulting in many new features
			and improvements.</blockquote>

	<h2 id="ar1-ui">DEVELOPING THE USER INTERFACE (UI)</h2>

	<p>Redesigning Mozio&rsquo;s website UI was an incremental process.</p>

	<p>We split design mockups into components that could be assigned to individual
		developers.</p>

	<p>For easier future development, these were designed to be reusable and
		responsive, and put together in a React component library.</p>

	<div class="image-block">
		<img class="post-image" src="img/mozio/component-card.png" alt="Mozio UI components">
		<span class="subtitle">UI components: Result cards</span>
	</div>

	<div class="image-block">
		<img class="post-image" src="img/mozio/component-dropdown.png" alt="Mozio UI components">
		<span class="subtitle">UI components: Language, Date & Currency selectors</span>
	</div>

		<img class="post-image" src="img/mozio/notification.png" alt="Mozio UI components">
		<span class="subtitle">UI components: Inline notifications</span>
	</div>

	<p>Designing the components in detail meant being able to improve how they
		worked, and how they solved Mozio&rsquo;s use cases.</p>

	<p>I progressively adapted the new visual language to all other Mozio pages,
		designing new components as they came and extrapolating new solutions.</p>

			<span class="subtitle">Schedule & class selector — Iteration 1 of 4</span>
		</div>

	<h2 id="ar1-agile">WORKING AGILE: OVERSEEING DESIGN-TO-DEVELOPMENT</h2>

	<p>Being an UX/UI designer in a company where half of the co-workers are
		developers means needing to speak both languages.</p>

	<p>We worked in weekly sprints, following the agile method. Product managers
		would assign features &amp; UI components to individual developers, and I would
		review and support this implementation.</p>

	<p>This meant juggling several distinct use cases at any given time, and provide
		support in the form of:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Styleguide specifications such as sizes, colors, states, etc</li>
		<li>Interactive user flows on how components worked</li>
		<li>Component behaviours and responses on different interactions</li>
		<li>Covering use cases not initially considered</li>
		<li>Adapting the design according to time and tech restrictions</li>
		<li>Providing icons and visual assets</li>
	</ul>

	<div class="image-block no-shadow">
		<img  class="post-image" src="img/mozio/spec-example.svg" alt="Specification sheets">
		<span class="subtitle">Component guidelines for developers</span>
	</div>

	<p>Video mockups were used to showcase interaction examples. </p>

	<div class="image-block">
		<video autoplay loop muted>
		  <source src="img/mozio/roundtrip-clean.mp4" type="video/mp4" alt="Mozio booking trip upsell animation">
		</video>
		<span class="subtitle">Roundtrip upsell (via After Effects)</span>
	</div>

	<p>Use cases were discussed collaboratively.</p>

	<h2 id="ar1-outcome">THE OUTCOME</h2>

	<p>Mozio platform had it's booking conversion rates increase <span style="font-weight: bold;">
		~90% over a period of 3 months.</span></p>

	<p>It also achieved:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Complete interface overhaul, beginning a new era for Mozio</li>
		<li>Front-end component library that could be reused for faster development</li>
		<li>Greatly improved main use cases</li>
		<li>A framework that would allow to begin designing for new use cases
			&mdash;&nbsp;Train &amp; Bus bookings, different schedules, flight types, ...</li>
	</ul>

	<p>With this new acquired growth, Mozio went on to successfully close a new
		Series round.</p>

	<h1 id="ar1-internal">WORKING INTERNAL PROJECTS</h1>

	<p>Improvements were also done internally.</p>

	<p>One way in how Mozio operates is by upselling their services in partnerships
		with Travel and Hotel booking websites. You know after you book a plane ticket,
		it asks if you want to also book your taxi?</p>

	<p>This is done with the use of a Mozio whitelabel that can be styled in line
		with each partners brand.</p>

		<div class="image-block">
			<img  class="post-image" src="img/mozio/whitelabel.jpg" alt="Mozio Whitelabels">
			<span class="subtitle">How Whitelabel will look like for Mozio partners</span>
		</div>

	<p>To create these, both designer and developer work was required. This meant
		was Sales &amp; Partnership teams would often have to wait for availability,
		hindering their ability to pitch and serve potential clients.</p>
	<p>And developers could not give full focus in building the main products.</p>

	<p>They also required an average of 3.5~ hours to go live.</p>

	<p>Tasked with the design of an internal tool that could help creating
		Whitelabels, I began by interviewing our departments on how they worked and
		how the process could be improved.</p>
	<p>A tool to allow Sales team to create Whitelabels by changing 5 different
		parameters was devised and mocked up.</p>

		<div class="image-block">
			<img  class="post-image" src="img/mozio/whitelabel-tool.jpg" alt="Whitelabel creation tool">
			<span class="subtitle">Whitelabel tool dashboard</span>
		</div>

	<p>This improved Whitelabel creation times from ~3.5 hours to ~10 minutes/each
		and free&rsquo;d valuable developer &amp; designer resources.</p>

	<h1 id="ar1-mobile">MEANWHILE, WITH THE MOBILE APP...</h1>

	<h2 id="ar1-start-2">GETTING STARTED</h2>

	<p>There was already groundwork done in the form of ideas and wireframes
		established by Mozio founders.</p>

	<p>Together with previous research in the form of 1-on-1 interviews, we began
		by discussing these in efforts to expand and list use cases that we could
		design for. Some of these were, but not limited to:</p>

		<div class="issue-list">
			<div class="issue-wrapper">
				<img class="column-1 issue-avatar" src="img/mozio/cross.svg" alt="Cross Web-Mobile Reservation Management"></img>
				<div class="column-2">
					<span class="issue-title">Cross Web-Mobile Reservation Management</span>
					<span class="issue-body">The user needed to have a single account and
						manage his bookings cross-platform</span>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="issue-wrapper">

				<div class="column-2">
					<span class="issue-title">Train & Tram Bookings</span>
					<span class="issue-body">Different tram systems have different requirements:
						entry stop, destination, timed or open ride
					</span>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="issue-wrapper">
				<img class="column-1 issue-avatar" src="img/mozio/destination.svg" alt="Destination/No Destination Use Cases"></img>
				<div class="column-2">
					<span class="issue-title">Destination/No Destination Use Cases</span>
					<span class="issue-body">The user could now book without a destination</span>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>

	<p>The launch of App could be broken down into 3 phases :</p>

	<ol>
		<li>A tool for Mozio customers to manage their bookings</li>
		<li>Add on-demand and scheduled rides booking capabilities</li>
		<li>Add Airport express line booking &mdash;&nbsp;focus on Heathrow Express
			(London, UK) and SEPTA (Philadelphia, US)</li>
	</ol>

	<p>This would allow iterative development and immediate testing. Efforts began
		with the iOS App, and later adapted for Android.</p>

	<h2 id="ar1-flow">USE CASES TO USER FLOWS: MOVING TO MOBILE</h2>

	<p>We started adapting <a href="https://www.mozio.com/">www.mozio.com</a> user
		flows to the mobile experience and creating new ones specific to mobile, such as:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Onboarding</li>
		<li>Sign in/sign up</li>
		<li>On-Demand booking (with &amp; without destination)</li>
		<li>Choosing picking schedule</li>
		<li>Airport express line booking</li>
		<li>etc...</li>
	</ul>

	<div class="image-block rotate">
		  <img class="bottom post-image" src="img/mozio/user-flow-1.svg" alt="Bus & Train mobile user flows"/>
		  <img class="top post-image" src="img/mozio/user-flow-2.svg" alt="Sign In/Sign Up mobile user flows"/>
		<span class="subtitle">User flows examples — Bus & Train conditional, Sign in/Sign up</span>
	</div>

	<p>One of the challenges was to make sure the website-to-mobile was a seamless
		experience.</p>

		<p>So a website-registered user could login on his mobile, have access
		to all his booking information and get notifications from cross-platform bookings.</p>

	<p>My main role working with the mobile app was developing the user experience.
		I helped make sure all use cases were covered and user flows were <span style="font-style:italic;">airtight</span>,
		and we could provide a smooth experience to our travellers.</p>

	<h2 id="ar1-wireframe">DESIGNING WIREFRAMES</h2>

	<p>With the user flows approved, developers could begin building the environment
		and logic. And we could begin Wireframe design to start having a feel for the
		app.</p>

		<div class="image-block">
			<img class="post-image" src="img/mozio/wire-map.jpg" alt="Wireframe user flow maps">
			<span class="subtitle">On-Demand to Pre-booked: Selecting time and day of ride</span>
		</div>

	<p>These wireframes picked cues from the ones provided by Mozio founders. They
		also helped fine-tune the user flows, in a back-and-forth process.</p>

	<p>During this time, we began exploring visual styles for the mobile app
		&mdash;&nbsp;how it could look like.</p>

	<h2 id="ar1-mockup">HIGH FIDELITY MOCKUPS: PUTTING IT TOGETHER</h2>

	<p>With a visual style approved, UI design could begin.</p>

	<p>The process was iterative and ran parallel to user flow, wireframing and
		development.</p>

	<p><blockquote>Working tasks &amp; projects in parallel sprints was a common theme. We had
		to make sure nobody was the bottleneck and developers would not be stuck waiting
		for design.</blockquote></p>
	<p>As final mockups came out, we began testing for their ease of use, affordance
		and usability. </p>

	<p>We did this by creating rapid prototypes with InVision/Proto.io and running
		usability tests with Mozio co-workers, as well as on the streets of San Francisco.</p>

	<p>This gave much needed feedback and kept the design process going.</p>

	<p style="text-align:center;">&mdash;</p>

	<p>Our final use case designed before launch was a booking &amp; ticketing
		experience for SEPTA, Philadelphia&rsquo;s public transit service.</p>

		<div class="image-block">
			<img  class="post-image" src="img/mozio/septa-screen.png" alt="SEPTA Mozio ticketing app">
		</div>

	<p>Mozio&rsquo;s mobile app launch happened first in Philadelphia, US, a week
		before the NFL Drafts of April 2017. </p>

	<p>The app acquired ~19,000 users in 2 days, with an average rating of 4.7 stars
		in the iOS app store.</p>

	<p>You can visit Mozio here, and download the mobile app here:
		<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mozio/id1103373539?mt=8">iOS</a> or
		<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mozio.android&hl=en">Android</a>.</p>

	<h1 id="ar1-closing">CLOSING THOUGHTS</h1>

	<p>Mozio was a fast-paced environment. Designing an unique user experience that
		could be consistent across Website and Mobile was a welcome challenge.</p>

	<p>Working remotely was efficient and pragmatic. I was able to see multiple
		projects to a conclusion, and provide results internally and externally.</p>

	<p>Mozio doubled their daily revenue over a period of 1 year.</p>
